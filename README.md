A new concept for a digital currency.
As cryptocurrencies evolve, new problems arrise. Some of the problems are obvious to every user (transaction fee, transaction time), other problems are obvious only to miners (hash power, electricity bills).
A lot of people would mine a cryptocurrency, but it has become more and more difficult to mine. There are big mining farms that gather a lot of hashpower, mining pools that distribute hashpower and coins among users but keep a fee that goes up to 6-10%, countries that have free electricity for miners.
This is far from the idea of a decentrilised currency Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind. A decentrilised cryptocurrency means a lot of equal ledgers dispersed all around the world. Not just 10, 20, 200, but millions on every computer using it.
But how to archieve this?
First of all this cryptocurrency will be based on the Cryptonote algorithm (Bytecoin, Boolberry, Dashcoin, ...)
First step is to make the database as small as possible for every user to download it easily. The technology is already available in Wild Keccak hash function, and it will be implemented in this cryptocurrency.
The second step is to implement a constraint for big mining farms/mining pools, or a reward for small scale users, to make the mining process fairer for everyone. This will hopefully make more people join the mining process distributing the ledger to a greater number of computers, distribute the coin evenly among users, and hopefully make the currency stable and long lasting.
All of the above combined with a 6 months open project developing, no ICO, no premined coins, no privileged users, should make the new coin attractive to new and old users of cryptocurrencies.
The question that might arrise is what will stop someone with a lot of money to gather a lot of hashpower?
The answer is nothing. All we can do is make it more complicated and expensive by rigging the coin distribution in the mining process to favour the small scale mining operations.
Will we be able to do it?
Stay tuned, and we will find out :)
